## General Trees

A tree is a data structure that looks like an upside down tree. These or non linear data-structures.

The bottom nodes in the tree are called leaf nodes.

## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a type of tree structure where each node can have no more than two children.

## Binary Search Tree

This tree separates it's child nodes and the lesser child will go left and the greater child will go right. This way the least value node is always the bottom left leaf, and the bottom right leaf is the greatest node. Duplicates are not allowed in a binary tree.
