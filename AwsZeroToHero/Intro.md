## Intro to AWS 
AWS is a worldwide distributer of data centers, IT services, and other development and economic services. Pay as you go pricing structure. You can choose a reason based on best server latency, minimize cost, or regulatory reasons.

## Availability zones
The server regions are split into several availability zones and connected through a fiber optic network.

## AWS management console
* web based interface to AWS
* Monitor costs
* Mobile app access allowed

## SDK and CLI access
Control services from the command line. Create applications using Software Development kits for all major languages.

`Lab notes are downloaded and ready for next session`

## Cloud Computing models 
* IaaS (infrastructure as a service)
* PaaS (Platform as as service)
* SaaS (Software as a service)

## Serverless Computing 
Allows you to build and run apps without needing to provision a server yourself 
ex. SimpleStorage service (S3), AWS Lambda for running cloud in the cloud

## AWS Storage Services
* S3 
* Glacier is the most cost effective, can set up auto-migration from S3 to Glacier 
* Elastic Block Store
* Elastic File System, this is networked storage for multi server access
* Storage Gateway
* Snowball is a portable device to migrate data
