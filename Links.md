  * [Red Green Refactor](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/test-driven-development-and-environments-with-javascript/red-green-refactor-workflow)
  * [Setting Up Jest](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/test-driven-development-and-environments-with-javascript/setting-up-jest)
  * [Setting Up Babel](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/test-driven-development-and-environments-with-javascript/setting-up-babel)

* The following lessons demonstrate using ```TDD``` to build out business logic in the Shape Tracker project:

* The following lessons explain best practices and additional tools we can implement to improve our testing experience with ```Jest```:
  * [Testing Best Practices](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/test-driven-development-and-environments-with-javascript/testing-best-practices)
  * [Expanding our Testing Tools: Adding Setup and Teardown](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/test-driven-development-and-environments-with-javascript/expanding-our-testing-tools-adding-setup-and-teardown)
  * [Improving Test Reports: Adding Test Coverage Information](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/test-driven-development-and-environments-with-javascript/improving-test-reports-adding-test-coverage-information)

* You may also want to update your ```ESLint``` configuration to include functional programming rules. If so, we recommend ```the eslint-plugin-fp library```:
  * [npm page for eslint-plugin-fp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-fp)
  * [GitHub page for eslint-plugin-fp](https://github.com/jfmengels/eslint-plugin-fp)

#### _Node, webpack, and npm_

* Installing ```node.js``` on Mac or Windows
  * [Installing node.js](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/setting-up-javascript/installing-node-js)
  * [Using node.js as a REPL](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react/functional-programming-with-javascript/using-node-in-the-command-line)
